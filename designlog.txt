Main files worked on: images.py and mian_images.py

finished:
    1. Main game loop structure
    2. Place random tile
Next step:
    Merge tiles, define rules for the merging.
    It's no longer times 2 mathematically

thoughts on an alternative way to achieve the game goal:
see if using dictionary to match images and number would work?
operations still imposed on numbers, but blit the corresponding images

finished: alternative_main.py
replacing numbers with images
the simplest way it to keep all the game logic, but modify the printMatrix() function
and use a dictionary to map the number with the images

To do:
focus on what pictures to choose,
since photo might not be enough, can reduce the size of the game, say,
print winning message when player reach 1024

when it's finished, check how to export .exe file from pyCharm.
