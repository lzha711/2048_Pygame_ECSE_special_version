# 2048_Pygame_ECSE_special_version

A fun 2-D game that replaces numbers with lecturer's profile photos from ECSE department, the University of Auckland.
The code was written in December 2019 as a Christmas fun game. In case I lost the source code in the PC, I decided to upload it to Github for better storage.

In memory of my supervisor, Prof. Sing Kiong Nguang.
