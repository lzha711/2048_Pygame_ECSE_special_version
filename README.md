# 2048_Pygame_ECSE_special_version

A fun 2-D game that replaces numbers with lecturer's profile photos from ECSE department, the University of Auckland.
The code was written in December 2019 as a Christmas fun game. In case I lost the source code in the PC, I decided to upload it to Github for better storage.

Platform: JetBrians PyCharm Community Edition 2019.2.3
How to run: 
  1. Unzip images.zip, and put all files (along with the unzipped folder of images) in one folder. Use Pycharm to open the 2048_ECSE_version.py file and run.
  2. On windows system only, run the .exe file

In memory of my supervisor, Prof. Sing Kiong Nguang.
